Delft3D Hydrodinamic model analisys 
Opening my netcdf output from DFlow-Fm and reading the water level file.
This script executes the calibration phase of the water level in hydrodynamics modelling, using the Nash Sutcliff, RMSE, %RMSE and Pearson to calculate the model efficiency

Here are some plot examples extrated from the output historical files
